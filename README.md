# Hi! 👋

Like many other budding data enthusiasts, my journey into data was nonlinear. I got my first introduction to SQL and understanding about the whole data ecosystem through [Shelovesdata](https://www.shelovesdata.com/). I joined Shelovesdata because I wanted to have a community with other data enthusiasts where I can learn from and grow with. Since then I have developed a passion for data and began self-teaching myself and seeking out resources to hone and improve my skills.


## A little more about me...

🖊️ I'm currently learning SQL, Python and Tableau

🏠 I've recently moved to Toronto

🎯 Currently working on changing my career to a Data Analyst

📚 Books that changed my life: Work Rules! (By Laszlo Bock), The Effective Engineer (By Edmund Lau) & The Hard Thing About Hard Things (By Ben Horowitz)

⚡ Fun fact: I have relocated 5 times : Bahrain 🡪 India 🡪 USA 🡪 Singapore 🡪  now Canada :)
