# Hi! 👋

My data journey, like that of many other aspiring data enthusiasts, was nonlinear. Shelovesdata provided me with my first introduction to SQL and an understanding of the entire data ecosystem. I joined Shelovesdata because I wanted to be a part of a community of data enthusiasts with whom I could learn and grow. Since then, I've developed a passion for data, and I've started self-teaching myself and looking for resources to hone and improve my skills.


## A little more about me...

🖊️ I'm currently learning SQL, Python and Tableau

🏠 I've recently moved to Toronto

🎯 Currently working on changing my career to a Data Analyst

📚 Books that changed my life: Work Rules! (By Laszlo Bock), The Effective Engineer (By Edmund Lau) & The Hard Thing About Hard Things (By Ben Horowitz)

⚡ Fun fact: I have relocated 5 times : Bahrain 🡪 India 🡪 USA 🡪 Singapore 🡪  now Canada :)
